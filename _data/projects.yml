- project: A1 Device (and it's many uses!)
  role: Project lead, manager, designer and engineer
  duration: Admit One / Collaborative Software Ltd
  # url: "#"
  description: The A1 Device is a codename for our custom computer unit that we now use in cinemas and theatres across the world. I chose the hardware components and wrote all the software myself.</br></br>They can be used to display kitchen information to chefs, or act as digital signage for customer facing screens. They also drive access control gates that can limit or control flow of customers at a site. It is a cheap, reliable computer unit designed to be user friendly and cut costs for customers, with all the software written in-house.</br></br>This was my first big R&D project and it was a great way to start working with hardware as well as software, as well as learn more about time management and delegation.
