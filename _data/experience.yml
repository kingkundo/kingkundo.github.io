  position: Software Developer
  duration:  September 2018 &mdash; April 2020
  #summary: 'Working in the cinema industry, my role at Admit One started as: fix and expand on the POS and ticketing software that our dozens of customers use across the globe. The challenge can range from simple bug fixes in POS software, to building all new device drivers for incompatible hardware. My good manners, respectful attitude and technological knowledge has led me to representing our team to customers and the public, having been one of two team members selected to go on several national and international sales/trade/industry shows and meetings.'
  summary: '<p>Working in the cinema industry, my role at Admit One was initially to fix bugs and implement new features in our POS and back office software. This was coding primarily in Delphi, sometimes at a low-level writing win32 DLLs and sometimes at a higher service API level.</br></br>I spent my first year or so getting through my assigned tasks quickly and without handholding, learning about the products and improving my coding.</br></br>In time I was put in a more customer facing role, being sent across the world to represent the company internationally at trade shows and meetings. I enjoy interfacing with customers and have made good business relationships with a lot of them.</p>'
